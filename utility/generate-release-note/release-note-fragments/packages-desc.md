## Prebuilt Packages

Iosevka provides a large variety of variants. Prebuilt variants are listed below. For all Monospace variants' packages, it will contain three _spacing variants_. You can either download the package containing all the spacing variants (recommended), or cherry-pick the variant with specific spacing.
  - _Default_: The default variant with ligatures. Various symbols, like arrows and geometric, are wide (2-column).
  - _Terminal_ (“Term”)：A narrower variant focusing terminal uses. Arrows and geometric symbols will be narrow to follow typical terminal usages.
  - _Fixed_: Exact monospace font without ligatures and wide glyphs. Since some environments cannot interpret Iosevka or Iosevka Term as monospace, and have difficulties with ligatures included, you can use Iosevka Fixed as an alternative.
